{"prompt":"What are 10Pearls Quality Objectives ->","completion":" Client satisfaction is the top priority.● To meet client expectations by delivering a reliable product.● Test early, regularly, and efficiently.\n"}
{"prompt":"Define 10Pearls Testing Process ->","completion":" Review and Analysis Requirement,Estimation,Test Planning and Strategy,Test cases \/ Scenario, est cases Execution \/ Testing and Bug Reporting,Reporting\n"}
{"prompt":"Steps related to Testing Audit Process and General Documentation ->","completion":" Sprint 0 Checklist (Manual And Automation Projects),A Review Process Overview,Standardized Documentation and Framework,QA Pulse\n"}
{"prompt":"What are Review and Analysis Requirement of testing process ->","completion":" We engaged our QA resources from the inception of the project where QA resources review the requirement and actively participate in grooming sessions where review the acceptance criteria and requirement documents to identify the unclear requirement. All the highlighted points discuss with the relevant stakeholders (PM, PDM, and Client) for clarification and act as a bridge for other team members from a requirement perspective. For requirement management, we are using Jira where we manage all the Epics, User Stories, and tasks.\n"}
{"prompt":"explain Estimation process  ->","completion":" Analysis of the requirement and create a questionnaire document for clarification.● After clarification, Identified the cases\/scenarios based on requirements and impacted areas. ● Create a WBS (Based on AC and Impacted areas) for testing and estimate each task. ● Share WBS and Estimations (in hrs.) with PM\/PDM for review. Use the same approach insprint or Kanban.\n"}
{"prompt":"what is Test Planning and Strategy ->","completion":" Based on the Functional and Non Functional requirements we will plan the testing strategy and create a test plan (Manual and Automation) according to the timeline. We will share the plan with the client as well to review the plan and to understand the 10Pearls testing process. n the test plan, we will cover the following areas:● In-scope and out-of-scope items are specified clearly in the document.● Finalized the testing approach which helps us during testing. ● Identify the testing levels\/type Like, ○ Functional and Non Functional Testing ○ Smoke Testing ○ Regression Testing (Manual and Automated) ○ UAT Testing ○ Responsive and browser compatibility testing ○ DB and API Testing○ And many others (based on the requirement)● Set the Test criteria (Entry, Suspension, Resumption, and Exit)● Selection of tools and technologies for manual and automated test case management.● Also, highlight the assumption and risks in the planning. Strategy for UAT and Production related testing: ● Developed the regression testing checklist and update it after every release.● Based on the discussion, execute the regression testing cycle on UAT and Production environment. For UAT and Production environment, we will prepare limited and detailed data based on client instructions. Also, based on the assignment of QA resources we will automate the regression suite for QA nd UAT environments where we can reduce the manual regression testing effort\n"}
{"prompt":"How Test cases \/ Scenario are created ->","completion":" Cases and Impacted areas discussed with PM\/PDM\/Client.● Create data set to use in test execution.● Create test cases based on acceptance criteria and impacted areas.● Using Internal (10Pearls) \/ other Test case management tools for managing the test cases.● The case should be reviewed by QA Lead or PM to evaluate the test coverage.● Also, create a smoke and regression checklist to test on Stage and UAT environment.\n"}
{"prompt":"How to start Test cases Execution \/ Testing and Bug Reporting ->","completion":" After deployment on the testing environment, start testing and execute the cases.● During the testing, if we identify the issue then we create a bug and assigned it to therelevant person to fix the issue. ● Move the ticket to the Ready for Stage \/ Done state, once we completed our testing cycle and bug verification. Also, added the testing note in the comments. ● If any expedite task request by stakeholders so paused the testing of the story\/task and moved to the expedite item based on the priority. ● After release, we will execute the regression testing cycle (manual or automated) on the deployed environment like Stage and UAT. ● We will also consider API, functional automation, performance, and security-related testing types during our testing.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is Reporting after release ->","completion":" We will share the release note after every release with released items and known issues.● Test run report will share for every release.● At the client's request, we will provide the test cases and scenarios for review.● Documenting and recording the recently developed items helps the team to gain information on developed modules.\n"}
{"prompt":"Explain why we need Sprint 0 Checklist (Manual And Automation Projects ->","completion":" The purpose of this checklist is to streamline the process for the testing of a project before it begins. All QA resources should have this checklist complete before the first sprint starts. This will help keep things on track and we will foresee risks associated with the delivery\/timeline of the project (if any). It will also help you go into the project more prepared and organized. This checklist informs a resource where to find all sorts of documents and code artifacts\n"}
{"prompt":"Briefly describe QA Review Process Overview ->","completion":" In general, manual and automation auditing activity for testing takes place every month for all the projects which require manual\/automation testing. In this activity, different reviewers are assigned to each project who checks the health of the project. Once the review has been finalized, it will share with all the stakeholders.\n"}
{"prompt":"What are the Standardized Documentation and Framework of testing at 10Pearls ->","completion":" We have our standardized documentation, every QA resource uses the same template for all the projects. Few are mentioned below,● Test Plan for Manual and Automation ● Bug Reporting Template ● Regression and Smoke Testing Checklist and guidelines ● Automation Framework like (Selenium, Cypress etc.\n"}
{"prompt":"Explain QA Pulse activity ->","completion":" A pulse is the weekly activity for all the QA resources where QA resources share the weekly progress, risks, achievements related to the project. QA resource rate the project on below criteria,● Level of requirement● Quality of builds provided for testing ● Provision of in-time builds ● Test case coverage ● Appropriate time for testing Rating parameters for all the above-mentioned criteria:● On Track ● Slightly Challenged ● Extremely Challenged ● Critical After submission, the Reviewer (Sr. QA Resource) conducts a session with the submitter and analyzes the project health and rates the project, and adds the final comment for delivery managers to take action accordingly\n"}
